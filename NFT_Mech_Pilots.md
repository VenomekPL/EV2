# Mech Pilots NFT

## Overview

Mech Pilots are purchasable NFTs that serve as player characters in EV2. Each pilot is a unique entity with randomized stats, feats, and weaknesses that directly influence gameplay performance. Pilots determine how your mech suit performs in combat and exploration.

## Pilot Characteristics

### Base Statistics

Each pilot possesses a set of core statistics that affect fundamental gameplay mechanics:

- **Reload Time** - How quickly weapons reload between shots
- **Accuracy** - Precision of weapon fire and targeting capability
- **Flight Speed** - Maximum velocity in aerial combat and movement
- **Maneuverability** - Responsiveness and agility in combat situations
- **Health** - Total damage a pilot can sustain before being defeated
- **Other Gameplay Aspects** - Additional stats determined by game developer

*Full stat list and ranges to be determined by Funtico development team*

### Stat Randomization

- **Fair & On-Chain**: All pilot stats are randomized fairly and verified on the blockchain
- **Identical Algorithm**: Each pilot uses the exact same randomization methodology
- **No Pay-to-Win**: Purchasing a pilot for more money does **not** guarantee better stats
- **Equal Starting Opportunity**: Every pilot has equal probability of having superior stats
- **Transparent Randomization**: Randomization can be verified through blockchain records

---

## Pilot Progression & Experience

### Experience Accumulation

Pilots gain experience points (XP) after each gameplay session:

- **Per-Mission XP**: Experience awarded based on mission completion, performance, and difficulty
- **On-Chain Recording**: All XP is recorded and verified on the blockchain
- **Permanent Pilot Growth**: Experience never resets—pilots improve permanently over time
- **Persistent History**: Complete pilot activity history available on-chain for transparency

### Leveling System

Pilots level up as they accumulate experience:

- **Progressive Stat Improvements**: Each level grants slight increases to base stats
- **Cumulative Power**: Well-experienced pilots are noticeably stronger than fresh pilots
- **Meaningful Distinction**: High-level pilots have measurable gameplay advantages
- **Long-term Investment**: Encourages commitment to favorite pilots

## Pilot Traits

### Open Question: Stat Point Distribution

The development team must decide on the fundamental randomization approach:

#### Option A: Fixed Point Pool (Equal Starting Value)

**Concept**: All pilots have stats that sum to an identical total, but distributed differently.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Perfectly balanced at creation—no inherent "better" fresh pilots
- ✅ All stat combinations equally viable strategically
- ✅ Purchasing never grants statistical advantage
- ✅ Specialization emphasized over overall power
- ✅ Aligns with "no pay-to-win" philosophy

**Example:**
- Pilot A: Accuracy 10, Speed 8, Health 7 (Total: 25)
- Pilot B: Accuracy 5, Speed 10, Health 10 (Total: 25)

#### Option B: Pure Randomization (Variable Power)

**Concept**: All stats are completely random with no sum constraint—some pilots are simply better by chance.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ True randomization appeals to collectors
- ✅ Exceptional pilots are genuinely rare and valuable
- ✅ Rarity drives collectibility and market interest
- ✅ Exciting "lucky pull" mechanic for purchases
- ✅ Creates status symbol for rare high-stat pilots

**Drawbacks:**
- ❌ Fresh purchase might grant unbalanced power
- ❌ Perception of pay-to-win despite fair randomization
- ❌ New players feel disadvantaged

## NFT Specifications

### Feats (2 Positive Traits)

Each pilot receives **two positive features** that provide gameplay bonuses or unique advantages:

#### Feat Examples

- **Close-Range Specialist**: Deal increased damage when enemies are within close proximity
- **Tough**: Reduce incoming damage by a flat amount (e.g., 10% damage reduction)
- **Precision Shot**: Increased accuracy with sniper or precision weapons
- **Shield Surge**: Regenerate health when not taking damage
- **Evasive**: Improved dodge chance or movement speed
- **Overheat Master**: Sustain higher fire rates without weapon cooldown penalties
- *Many more to be designed by development team*

### Weaknesses (1 Negative Trait)

Each pilot has **one weakness** that creates strategic tradeoffs and specialization:

#### Weakness Examples

- **Stun Vulnerable**: Take increased stun duration (e.g., -20% stun weakness, meaning 20% longer stuns)
- **Heavy Frame**: Reduced flight speed or maneuverability
- **Overheats Quickly**: Weapons cool down slower
- **Short Battery Life**: Reduced shield duration or energy pool
- **Slow Reload**: Extended weapon reload times
- **Glass Cannon**: Reduced health or damage resistance
- *Many more to be designed by development team*

## Trait Randomization

### Fairness Principles

- **Random Assignment**: Feats and weaknesses are assigned randomly to each pilot
- **Diverse Builds**: Randomization creates vast numbers of unique specialist pilots
- **Strategic Diversity**: No single "best" build exists—different pilots excel in different scenarios
- **Equal Probability**: Every trait combination has fair odds of being generated
- **On-Chain Verification**: All randomization is verifiable through blockchain records

### Resulting Variety

The combination of randomized stats, two unique feats, and one weakness creates **tremendous build diversity**:

- Players discover specialized pilots that match their playstyle
- Different pilots excel in different mission types (PvE vs PvP)
- Strategic team composition in multiplayer (varied specialist pilots)
- Natural collecting incentive through interesting trait combinations

---

## Gameplay Impact

### Pilot Selection & Strategy

1. **Individual Playstyle**: Choose pilots that match your preferred combat approach
2. **Mission Optimization**: Different pilots excel in different scenarios
3. **Team Synergy**: In cooperative play, different pilot specialists complement each other
4. **PvP Matchups**: Pilot traits create interesting rock-paper-scissors dynamics

### No Immediate Pay-to-Win

- First purchase does **not** guarantee superior pilot
- Randomization ensures statistical fairness
- Better pilots may exist but require luck, not additional spending
- Secondary market trading is a separate economic layer (see [Second-Hand Economy](Second-Hand Economy.md))
- Level progression is earned through gameplay, not purchasing power

---

## NFT Specifications

- **Asset Type**: Purchasable NFT
- **Tradeable**: Yes (via secondary market)
- **Blockchain Verified**: All stats, feats, and weaknesses recorded on-chain
- **Uniqueness**: Each pilot has unique randomized attributes
