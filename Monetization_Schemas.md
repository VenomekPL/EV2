# Blockchain Monetization Schemas

## Overview

This page documents the primary revenue streams and monetization mechanics powered by blockchain technology in EV2. The monetization model is based on limited edition "booster packs" similar to trading card games, containing randomized NFT rewards. This approach creates sustainable revenue while aligning with Web3 principles of asset scarcity, collectibility, and player-driven economy.

## Core Philosophy

### Booster Pack Model

EV2 adopts a **limited edition booster pack system** inspired by trading card games:

- **Fixed Supply**: Each booster edition limited to specific quantity (e.g., 10,000 packs)
- **Randomized Contents**: Different items in each pack, with defined randomization schema
- **Edition Scarcity**: Older editions become unavailable, creating collectibility
- **Unopened Value**: Sealed booster packs retain value as collectible items
- **Secondary Market**: Boosters tradeable on all supported platforms
- **Transparent Odds**: Drop rates published for all randomization

### Revenue Sustainability

- **Accessible Entry**: $10 USD minimum entry point attracts broad audience
- **Sustainable Spending**: $10-30 USD per month engagement from diverse player base
- **Seasonal Rotation**: New limited packs every 2-4 weeks maintain engagement
- **Player Retention**: Continuous new purchase opportunities without predatory mechanics
- **Collectibility Appeal**: Unopened legacy packs increase in value over time

## Booster Pack Editions

### Pack Structure Overview

Each booster pack contains:
- **Defined Contents**: Specific items guaranteed or randomized per edition
- **Randomization Schema**: Published probabilities for randomized items
- **Edition Identification**: Unique name and artwork for each edition
- **Supply Cap**: Maximum packs producible (e.g., 10,000 per edition)
- **Minting Date**: Timestamp recorded on blockchain
- **Unopened Bonus**: Sealed packs maintain original contents until opened

### Pioneer Booster Pack (Example)

**Target Audience**: New players and early adopters
**Price**: $30 USD
**Supply**: 10,000 packs maximum
**Player Reach**: Supports 10,000-30,000 players (pilots/suits transferable)

#### Pack Contents

**Guaranteed Items:**
- **3 Randomized Pilots**: Random stat combinations, varying rarity
- **3 Baseline Mech Suits**: One of each basic suit type (Tank, Assault, Scout) guaranteed—no randomization
- **1 Pioneer Chroma Skin**: Exclusive cosmetic for early players
- **1 Early Access Token**: Grants access to exclusive pioneer-only content
- **2,000 Premium Currency Points**: Usable for cosmetics or battle pass

#### Edition Details

- **Artwork**: Distinctive pioneer-themed booster pack design
- **Blockchain Recording**: All pack contents recorded on-chain
- **Transferability**: Unopened packs tradeable at any time
- **Opening Irreversible**: Once opened, pack dissolves and rewards minted as NFTs
- **Collectibility**: Unopened Pioneer packs become legacy items

#### Expected Player Reach

- 10,000 packs sold
- 3 pilots per pack = 30,000 pilot NFTs
- 3 suits per pack = 30,000 suit NFTs
- Pilots + suits transferable = easy redistribution among player base
- Estimated 10,000-30,000 active players from single edition

### Edition Rotation Examples

### Limited-Time Event Packs

#### Event Pack Features

## Limited Edition & Scarcity Mechanics

### Edition Scarcity Value

Limited production creates natural scarcity:

#### Supply Economics

- **10,000 Pioneer Packs**: Abundant for first edition, but cap prevents oversupply
- **8,000 Sentinel Packs**: Slightly more scarce second edition
- **5,000 Forge Packs**: Rare third edition
- **Declining Supply**: Later editions increasingly limited
- **Eventual Rotation**: First editions rotate back after player demand evident

#### Unopened Pack Collectibility

Sealed booster packs become collectible assets:

- **Original Supply**: 10,000 Pioneer Packs at launch
- **Active Opened**: ~7,000 packs opened into gameplay circulation
- **Unopened Remaining**: ~3,000 packs remain sealed
- **Legacy Premium**: Sealed Pioneer packs trade for $50-200 USD (vs $30 original)
- **Speculation Market**: Collectors and speculators seek rare unopened editions
- **Generational Value**: First-edition packs command highest premiums

### Scarcity-Driven Engagement

- Players hunt complete sealed collections
- Unopened packs displayed like collectible cards
- Account status tied to collection completion
- Trading market creates secondary engagement

---

## Anti-Predatory Mechanics

### Transparent Randomization

All randomization fully disclosed:

- **Published Odds**: Drop rates disclosed for all randomized items
- **No Hidden Mechanics**: Complete probability tables available
- **Pity Systems**: Guaranteed rare drops after X packs (if randomized)
- **Blockchain Verification**: Randomization provably fair on-chain

### No Stat Advantage

- All pack contents cosmetic or utility, never pure power
- Pilots randomized fairly (same probabilities as earned)
- Suits basic tier (no advantage over earned suits)
- Cosmetics purely visual
- No "pay for power" mechanics

### Reasonable Pricing

- $30 entry point accessible globally
- Multiple price tiers for different budgets
- No constant escalation of prices
- Seasonal sales and promotions fair to late-comers

### Engagement, Not Extraction

- Packs support 2-4 week engagement cycles
- $10-30 per month average is sustainable, not predatory
- Free-to-play path viable (just slower progression)
- No forced spending to enjoy game

## Secondary Market Revenue Share

### Monetization from Ecosystem Activity

While packs are primary revenue, secondary market activity generates:

#### Creator Royalties

- **Standard NFT Royalty**: 3-5% of secondary market sales
- **Applied To**: All booster pack contents when traded
- **Example**: Pilot sells for $100, creator receives $3-5
- **Accumulation**: With millions in trading volume, significant recurring revenue

#### Platform Fees (Optional)

- **In-Game Marketplace**: 5% transaction fee (from seller, buyer, or split)
- **3rd Party Markets**: OpenSea collects fees, but EV2 earns royalties

---

## Sustainability & Balance

### Economic Lifecycle

**Launch Phase (Months 1-3):**
- High player acquisition through booster appeal
- Strong revenue from new player spending
- Community building through packs

**Growth Phase (Months 3-12):**
- Continued new editions maintain engagement
- Secondary market trading becomes active
- Word-of-mouth organic growth
- Sustained player spending

**Maturity Phase (Year 2+):**
- Stable player base with churn management
- New content and editions drive spending
- Secondary market sustains engagement
- Live service updates maintain relevance

### Risk Mitigation

- **Oversaturation**: Cap editions to prevent supply flood
- **Price Inflation**: Carefully control edition supplies vs demand
- **Fatigue**: Rotate editions to prevent "same pack fatigue"
- **Competitor Entry**: Continuous innovation keeps packs valuable
- **Market Crashes**: Secondary market natural price discovery prevents bubbles

Considerations for refinement:
- Regional pricing adjustments
- Currency fluctuation management
- Seasonal demand forecasting
- Secondary market fee structure
- Creator royalty percentages
