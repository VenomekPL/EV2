# Guild Tokens NFT

## Overview

Guild Tokens are purchasable NFTs that represent membership and governance rights within blockchain-managed organizations called Guilds. Each Guild operates as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling collective ownership, shared resources, and cooperative gameplay. Guild Tokens grant players access to exclusive collective content, shared assets, and democratic decision-making over guild funds and direction.
