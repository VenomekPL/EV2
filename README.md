# EV2: Earth Version 2

## Overview

**EV2** is a free-to-play, Destiny 2-style sci-fi looter-shooter RPG developed by Funtico and Frozen Dawn Entertainment, available on PC (Steam), PS5, and Xbox. Set in a universe where cutting-edge technology meets the remnants of ancient civilizations across five expansive open-world maps, EV2 challenges players to defend humanity against Zadrovan, the Hive Mother, and her relentless interdimensional infestation.

In EV2, you fight in one of five advanced **EV2 combat suits**—Brute, Cloaker, Pathfinder, Mag, or Valkyrie—each with unique skills, jetpack flight mechanics, and weapon restrictions. Face otherworldly threats guided by Everbeast, the last uncorrupted El'Dar deity, as you loot enemies for weapons, ammo, gear, and battery resources. Craft custom weapons from modular components, stack gear with stat bonuses, and engage in cooperative PvE campaigns, raids, or competitive PvP modes with Web3 play-to-earn opportunities through EV2 token competitions.

## Setting & Narrative

Humanity battles Zadrovan, the Hive Mother, whose interdimensional Vreck infestation threatens to consume all five El'Dar energy frequencies (Primal, Magic, Psychic, Divine, Tech) and evolve into a multiversal singularity. The World Power Organization (WPO) engineers five distinct EV2 combat suits, each channeling a unique El'Dar energy core to counter parasitic corruption:

- **Brute**: Graviton Engine (purple) - crushes Vreck with gravity wells
- **Cloaker**: Spectral Engine (red) - phases through burrow paths
- **Pathfinder**: Nuclear Engine (yellow) - irradiates parasites on contact
- **Mag**: Chaos Engine (blue) - disrupts hive-mind signals
- **Valkyrie**: Rift Engine (green) - seals dimensional breaches

Guided by **Everbeast**, the last uncorrupted El'Dar deity, players traverse five open-world maps—each a fallen world Zadrovan needs to complete her evolution. Your mission: **starve the hive**. Burn her harvest. Deny her the frequencies. Every parasite killed, every Vreck crushed, every world saved is a blow to her godhood.
