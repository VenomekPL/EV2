# Gear System (Armor Suit Parts)

## Overview

EV2's gear system consists of **5 lootable armor pieces** that provide stat bonuses and enhance your suit's performance. Each gear piece is a tradeable NFT with specific stat modifiers based on rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic). Gear pieces stack with your chosen suit class ([EV2 Combat Suits](EV2_Combat_Suits.md)) and weapons ([NFT Weapons](NFT_Weapons.md)) to create powerful builds optimized for PvE campaigns, raids, or PvP combat.

Unlike your suit (which is your character class), **gear pieces are lootable and tradeable**, dropped from enemies (PvE) or players (PvP), and can be customized with cosmetic skins via battle pass or achievements.

## Gear Acquisition

- **Raid Drops**: 6-player raids offer highest-tier gear

### Risk of Gear Loss (PvP Only)

- **Common Gear**: Risk losing one common-tier piece if killed in PvP

  - Repetitive earning allows free progression
- **EV2 Tokens (Hard Currency)**: Purchased or won in tournaments
  - Purchase Epic, Legendary, Exotic gear
  - Faster progression or skip grinding

### Crafting Gear

Combine lower-tier gear to craft higher-tier gear:

- **Uncommon → Rare**: 5 Uncommon pieces craft 1 Rare
- **Rare → Epic**: 5 Rare pieces craft 1 Epic
- **Epic → Legendary**: 10 Epic pieces craft 1 Legendary
- **Legendary → Exotic**: Extremely rare, requires special materials or tournament wins

### Secondary Market Trading
