# Gear System (5-Piece Armor NFT)

## Overview

EV2's gear system consists of **5 lootable armor pieces** that are tradeable NFTs with stat bonuses based on rarity. Each gear piece stacks with your chosen suit class ([EV2 Combat Suits](EV2_Combat_Suits.md)) and weapons ([NFT Weapons](NFT_Weapons.md)) to optimize builds for PvE or PvP.

**Critical for NFT Economy**: Unlike suits (which are character classes), **gear pieces are lootable and tradeable NFTs**, dropped from enemies/players or purchased with Holocrons (soft currency) and EV2 Tokens (hard currency).

## Gear Acquisition

### Purchasing with Currency
- **Holocrons** (Free-to-Earn): Purchase Common, Uncommon, Rare gear
- **EV2 Tokens** (Purchased/Won): Purchase Epic, Legendary, Exotic gear

### Crafting Gear
Combine lower-tier gear to craft higher-tier gear:
- **5 Common** → 1 Uncommon
- **5 Uncommon** → 1 Rare
- **5 Rare** → 1 Epic
- **10 Epic** → 1 Legendary
- **Special Materials** → 1 Exotic (extremely rare)

### Secondary Market Trading

- Trade complete gear sets (all 5 pieces) as bundles
- Suit-specific gear commands different prices based on meta demand

## Suit-Specific Gear Optimization (Affects NFT Value)

## NFT Market Dynamics

### Meta-Driven Pricing
- Gear prices fluctuate based on PvP/PvP meta shifts
- Popular builds drive demand for specific stat combinations
- Suit population affects market (e.g., more Brute players = higher Torso prices)

### Build Optimization
- "God rolls" (perfect stat combos at Exotic tier) worth 10x+ normal gear
- Complete 5-piece sets with synergistic stats command premium prices
- Flexibility: Swap gear to adapt to meta without re-rolling stats

### Investment Strategy
- Early adopters profit by identifying meta shifts
- Exotic gear from tournaments retains long-term value
- Complete builds (5 pieces) sold as bundles command higher prices than individual pieces

---

## Inventory & Storage

Players have a **200-slot inventory** to store gear:
- **Expandable**: Purchase additional storage with EV2 Tokens
- **Auto-Sell**: If full, oldest common-tier items auto-sell for Holocrons (rare/legendary never auto-sell)
- **Locking**: Lock items to prevent accidental selling or loss
- **Sorting**: Sort by rarity, stat type, or acquisition date

## Cosmetic Customization

Gear pieces can be visually customized without affecting stats:
- **Skins**: Apply cosmetic skins via battle pass or achievements
- **Chroma Colors**: Visual color themes ([NFT Chroma Skins](NFT_Chroma_Skins.md))
- **Stat Preservation**: Skins are purely visual; stats unchanged
- **Mix & Match**: Combine different gear skins for unique looks
