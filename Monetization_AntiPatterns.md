# Monetization Anti-Patterns

## Overview

This page documents monetization schemes to **avoid** in EV2. These are critical guardrails that protect EV2's credibility as a genuine Web3 game rather than a "crypto scheme." The fundamental principle: **wealth must not determine power**.

---

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: No Direct Power Purchase

**What NOT to do:**
- Selling weapons strictly better than earned weapons
- Offering pilots with guaranteed superior stats
- Purchasable items that provide unmatchable performance

**Why:** Immediate pay-to-win perception kills community trust and attracts only speculative players.

---

### Rule 2: Fair Randomization

**What TO do:**
- Every player has equal probability of rare stat combinations
- Purchasing doesn't reduce chance of superior stats
- Same algorithm applied to all purchases

**Why:** Wealthy players can afford quantity, not quality advantage.

---

### Rule 3: Specialization Over Superiority

**What NOT to do:**
- Creating a dominant meta build
- New items always strictly better than old items
- Power creep that makes old purchases obsolete

**What TO do:**
- Different pilots excel in different scenarios
- Rock-paper-scissors dynamics where builds counter each other
- Horizontal progression: options not upgrades

**Why:** Ensures no single playstyle dominates regardless of spending.

---

### Rule 4: Cosmetics Are Only Visual

**What NOT to do:**
- Darker cosmetics that blend into environment
- Brighter cosmetics that distract/blind enemies
- Cosmetics that reduce hitbox or reveal visibility
- Cosmetics that obscure ability effects

**What TO do:**
- All cosmetics equally visible and conspicuous
- No hitbox changes from customization
- Purely aesthetic modifications only

**Why:** Competitive fairness requires equal visibility for all players.

---

### Rule 5: Progression Is Earned, Not Purchased

**What NOT to do:**
- Selling completed accounts or pre-leveled characters
- Instant max-level pilots for purchase
- "Level skip" mechanics with real money
- Experience multipliers purchasable repeatedly

**What TO do:**
- Pilot levels account-bound to original owner
- Experience and progression earned through gameplay
- Level progression always time-gated by play requirement

**Why:** Achievement must be meaningful; progression must be earned.

---

### Rule 6: Non-Rerollable Randomization

**What TO do:**
- Randomized stats locked in at purchase (no rerolls)
- Permanent stat commitment prevents "shopping" for perfect stats
- Players respect their random build's unique characteristics

**Why:** Prevents wealthy players from acquiring objectively superior combinations through repeated rerolling.

---

### Rule 7: Transparent Odds & No Predatory Gacha

**What NOT to do:**
- Undisclosed drop rates in randomization
- Limited-time "rare drops" creating artificial urgency
- No pity systems (guaranteed rarity thresholds)
- Intentionally inflated rarity for cash drops

**What TO do:**
- All rarities obtainable through gameplay
- Disclose all randomization odds transparently
- Implement pity systems (guaranteed rare every 50 rolls, for example)

**Why:** Players deserve to know the math; transparency builds trust.

---

### Rule 8: Sustainable Revenue, Not Extraction

**What NOT to do:**
- Design focused on extracting maximum cash per player
- Artificial grinds requiring payment to skip
- Constant price escalation without value justification
- Timed content forcing daily login requirements

**What TO do:**
- Steady sustainable revenue model
- Healthy mix of F2P and P2P monetization
- Both F2P and paying players valued equally
- Long-term player retention over short-term extraction

**Why:** Games with extraction models die when whales leave; sustainable models create communities.

---

### Rule 9: F2P Viability

**What TO do:**
- Free-to-play genuinely competitive
- Secondary market enables F2P access to strong builds
- Progression accessible without spending
- Trading enables wealth creation for non-spenders

**Why:** Strong F2P option creates healthy player population and economy.

---

### Rule 10: The Web3 Legitimacy Test

**Question: Would a hardcore Web3 gamer play this game?**

If the answer is "No, because of pay-to-win mechanics," the game has failed.

Genuine Web3 gamers value:
- ✅ True blockchain asset ownership
- ✅ Fair, transparent systems
- ✅ Genuine fun games, not cash grabs
- ❌ Pay-to-win "crypto schemes"
- ❌ Promises of financial returns

**EV2's Success Depends On:** Being a genuinely fun game with blockchain integration, not a blockchain project disguised as a game.

---

## Summary Checklist

### ❌ DO NOT:
- Sell power for real money
- Allow infinite rerolling for wealthy players
- Create dominant meta requiring specific paid items
- Sell cosmetics affecting gameplay (visibility, hitboxes)
- Offer paid account progression skips
- Promise financial returns or income
- Implement aggressive power creep
- Design for addiction and burnout

### ✅ DO:
- Keep randomization fair for all purchase quantities
- Design multiple viable specialized builds
- Make progression earnable, not purchasable
- Disclose odds transparently
- Restrict cosmetics to pure visuals
- Support multiple viable playstyles
- Ensure secondary market enables F2P success
- Build sustainable revenue model
