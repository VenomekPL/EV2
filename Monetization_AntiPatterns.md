# Monetization Anti-Patterns

## Overview

This page documents monetization schemes and practices to **avoid** in EV2. These are common pitfalls in blockchain gaming that negatively impact player experience, community health, and long-term game sustainability. Understanding what NOT to do is critical for maintaining player trust and ensuring genuine Web3 gamers see EV2 as a legitimate gaming experience rather than a "crypto scheme."

---

## Direct Pay-to-Win Mechanics

### Why This Is Critical

Direct pay-to-win is the **single biggest threat** to EV2's credibility:

- **Attracts Wrong Audience**: Only "crypto-bros" seeking quick ROI, not genuine gamers
- **Repels Real Players**: Experienced Web3 gamers immediately abandon P2W games
- **Kills Long-Term Community**: No sustainable player base with P2W mechanics
- **Regulatory Risk**: P2W can trigger gambling or financial regulation
- **Toxic Environment**: P2W games breed resentment and toxicity
- **Short Revenue Lifespan**: Initial whales eventually leave, killing the game

### Examples to AVOID

#### ❌ Direct Power Purchase

- Selling weapons that are strictly better than earned weapons
- Offering pilots with guaranteed superior stats vs randomized versions
- Purchasable items that provide unmatchable performance
- Premium cosmetics that reduce visibility/increase hit size

#### ❌ Experience/Progression Boosters (Excessive)

- Unlimited XP multipliers purchasable repeatedly
- Battle pass guaranteeing level-ups without playing
- One-time character resets to "optimize" random stats
- Instant maximum-level characters for purchase

#### ❌ Stat Rerolling Mechanics

While rerolling can create subtle P2W, careful design can mitigate:

**Problem Scenario:**
- Wealthy player buys 100 pilot randomizations
- Eventually gets pilots with perfect stat combinations
- F2P player can only afford 1-2 pilots per week
- Over time, wealthy player has objectively better pilots

**Solution (See Below):** Eliminate rerolling entirely, or implement hard caps on rerolls per player.

### What EV2 Should Do INSTEAD

✅ **Fair Randomization**:
- Every player has equal probability of rare stat combinations
- Purchasing doesn't reduce chance of superior stats
- Same algorithm applied to all purchases

✅ **Specialization Over Superiority**:
- Different pilots excel in different scenarios
- No single "best" pilot that beats all others
- Rock-paper-scissors dynamics where different builds counter each other

✅ **Non-Rerollable Randomization**:
- Randomized stats locked in at purchase (no rerolls)
- Commitment mechanic prevents "shopping" for perfect stats
- Players respect their randomized build's unique characteristics

✅ **Account-Bound Progression**:
- Level progression always earned through gameplay
- No "level skip" purchasable with real money
- Time investment creates natural progression gates

## The Pilot Randomization Paradox

### The Subtle Pay-to-Win Risk

Even with fair randomization, pay-to-win can emerge:

**Theoretical Problem:**
- Wealthy player purchases 100 pilots
- F2P player purchases 2 pilots
- By probability, wealthy player will have more top-tier stat combinations
- Over time, wealthy players dominate through quantity purchases

### Why This Is Still Acceptable (With Caveats)

The key difference: **specialization, not superiority**

- Pilot A: High accuracy, average speed, average health
- Pilot B: Low accuracy, high speed, high health

These pilots are **different specialists**, not power tiers:

- Pilot A excels in long-range precision builds
- Pilot B excels in close-range aggressive builds
- Neither is objectively "better"—they excel in different scenarios
- Skilled player with Pilot A can outplay wealthy player with Pilot B

### Preventing This From Becoming Pay-to-Win

**Essential Design Principles:**

1. **No Dominant Meta Build**
   - Game design must ensure no single playstyle dominates
   - Multiple viable strategies at competitive level
   - Hard-counter dynamics prevent single-build dominance
   - Patch and balance preventing power creep

2. **Specialization Over Scaling**
   - Pilots modify gameplay, not just add numbers
   - Different specialist builds for different missions/playstyles
   - Team composition matters more than individual pilot power
   - Build synergy more important than raw stats

3. **Hard Caps on Purchase Efficiency**
   - Limited pilots purchasable per season/month
   - Soft caps prevent spending abuse
   - Strategic purchasing more valuable than pure spending
   - Time investment still competitive with money investment

4. **Permanent Stat Commitment**
   - No rerolling pilots after purchase
   - No stat-changing mechanics
   - Commitment creates respect for randomization
   - Prevents "shopping" for perfect combinations

5. **Balanced Secondary Market**
   - Excellent pilots available on secondary market
   - F2P players can earn currency for high-level pilots
   - Trading enables access to strong builds without spending
   - Prevents wealth gap from determining power gap

## Predatory Cosmetics

### Why This Matters

Cosmetics should NEVER provide gameplay advantage:

- ✅ Cosmetics accepted: Visual skins that look cool
- ❌ Cosmetics rejected: Darker skins that blend into environment
- ❌ Cosmetics rejected: Brighter skins that distract/blind enemies
- ❌ Cosmetics rejected: Smaller skins that reduce hitbox
- ❌ Cosmetics rejected: Cosmetics that obscure ability effects

### Cosmetic Rules

- All cosmetics must be equally visible/conspicuous
- No hitbox changes from cosmetics
- No performance changes from visual customization
- Purely aesthetic modifications only
- Test cosmetics for potential gameplay advantages before release

---

## Loot Box & Gacha Predation

### What to AVOID

#### ❌ Predatory Loot Box Systems

- Random drop rates that funnel cash spending
- Limited-time "rare drops" creating urgency
- No pity systems (guaranteed rarity thresholds)
- Intentionally inflated rarity for cash drops

#### ❌ Battle Pass Psychological Tricks

- Artificial progression that requires purchase
- Filler content in battle pass requiring spending to skip
- Seasonal resets forcing repurchase every 3 months
- FOMO-driven exclusive cosmetics

#### ❌ Limited-Time Cosmetics Without Availability

- Exclusive cosmetics never returning
- Event cosmetics permanently unavailable
- Creating status symbols requiring real-money spending
- "FOMO fatigue" from constant missed opportunities

### What EV2 SHOULD Do INSTEAD

✅ **Fair Loot Distribution**:
- All rarities obtainable through gameplay
- No gameplay-affecting items in loot boxes
- Transparent drop rates disclosed to players
- Pity systems (guaranteed rare every 50 rolls, for example)

✅ **Reasonable Battle Pass**:
- Free tier provides value without spending
- Premium tier optional, cosmetic-only
- No artificial grind padding
- 3-4 months per season (not rushing)
- Cosmetics return in future rotations

✅ **Limited Cosmetics Handled Fairly**:
- Event cosmetics return on rotation
- Permanent availability of all meaningful cosmetics
- Limited-time doesn't mean permanently exclusive
- New players can access past cosmetics

## Account Progression Selling

### What to AVOID

- ❌ Selling completed accounts (Smurf farming)
- ❌ Leveling services (pay to skip progression)
- ❌ Pre-leveled characters for purchase
- ❌ Instant max-level pilots or suits

### Why This Ruins Games

- Creates account trading black market
- Security vulnerabilities from account selling
- Destroys sense of progression
- Enables RMT (real money trading) markets
- Undermines earned achievement value

### What EV2 SHOULD Ensure

✅ Non-tradeable Progression:
- Pilot levels account-bound to original owner
- Suit leveling cannot transfer
- Weapon progression tied to individual weapon NFT
- Experience and progression are earned, not purchased

✅ Account Security:
- No account sales official or unofficial
- Single ownership per account
- Trading restricted to assets, not accounts
- Security prevents account farming

## Aggressive Monetization & Burnout

### What to AVOID

#### ❌ Extraction-Focused Monetization

- Design focused on extracting maximum cash per player
- Artificial grinds requiring payment to skip
- Constant pressure to spend to remain competitive
- Timed content forcing daily login requirements

#### ❌ Constant Price Escalation

- Regular price increases without value justification
- "New player pricing" that escalates later
- Premium currency inflation making items unaffordable
- Creating perception of mandatory spending

#### ❌ Engagement Burnout Mechanics

- Designing for addiction rather than fun
- Artificial scarcity forcing buying decisions
- Daily login requirements creating obligation
- Fear-of-missing-out as primary motivator

### Player Retention vs Extraction

**Extraction Model (SHORT-TERM):**
- Maximize revenue per player
- Aggressive monetization pushes whales
- F2P players feel squeezed
- Community becomes hostile
- Game dies when whales leave

**Retention Model (LONG-TERM):**
- Steady sustainable revenue
- Healthy mix of monetization
- F2P and P2P both valued
- Strong community ecosystem
- Decade-plus game lifespan

**EV2 Should Choose:** Retention model for long-term success

## Power Creep & Stat Inflation

### What to AVOID

- ❌ New items always better than old items
- ❌ Constant stat increases on new cosmetics
- ❌ Forced gear refreshes every season
- ❌ Old content becoming "useless" vs new content
- ❌ Removing viable builds through balance patches

### Why Power Creep Kills Games

- Makes old purchases feel immediately obsolete
- Forces constant spending to stay competitive
- Creates expectation of constant "better" items
- Eventually becomes unsustainable mathematically
- Players leave feeling cheated

### What EV2 SHOULD Ensure

✅ **Horizontal Progression**:
- New items provide options, not just upgrades
- Old weapons remain viable long-term
- Different builds beat different builds
- Balance patches adjust, don't invalidate
- Seasonal resets maintain competitive health

✅ **Stat Ceilings**:
- Maximum possible stats designed from start
- Power growth slows as level increases
- Late-game power tiers well-defined
- Prevents endless escalation

---

## Regulatory Pitfalls

### What to AVOID

- ❌ Classifying game as gambling/casino
- ❌ Undisclosed odds in randomization
- ❌ Marketing as "investment opportunity"
- ❌ Promising returns or income guarantees
- ❌ Operating as unregistered securities offering

### Compliance Requirements

✅ **Transparency**:
- Disclose all randomization odds
- Clear terms of service
- No misleading marketing

✅ **Legal Structure**:
- Consult legal counsel (not financial advice)
- Comply with local gaming regulations
- Respect MiCA European regulations
- Non-custodial wallet avoids many requirements

✅ **Marketing Responsibility**:
- "Play for fun" messaging, not "earn income"
- No guaranteed returns promises
- Educational about blockchain risks
- Clear about asset volatility
