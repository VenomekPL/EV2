# Weapon Component System (NFT)

## Overview

EV2's weapon system enables players to **craft personalized firearms** using **modular components** that are tradeable NFTs. Components are looted from enemies/players or purchased with Holocrons (soft currency, earned free) and EV2 Tokens (hard currency, purchased/won).

Unlike fixed weapon drops, EV2 lets you **build custom weapons** by combining six component types: **bullets, barrels, triggers, mags, stocks, and scopes**. Each component modifies weapon stats (DPS, Range, Intensity, Shots per Minute, Stability) and is a separate NFT asset.

---

## The Six Component Types (All NFTs)

### 1. Bullets
- **Function**: Sets base **damage type** (Acid, Armor Buster, Fire, Ice, Impact, Lightning, Shield Breaker)
- **NFT Value**: Damage type affects PvE/PvP effectiveness; rarer bullets have stronger effects

### 2. Barrels
- **Function**: Adjusts **Range** and **Intensity** (damage output)
- **NFT Value**: Long barrels (sniper builds) vs short barrels (close-quarters) serve different metas

### 3. Triggers
- **Function**: Modifies **Shots per Minute** (fire rate)
- **NFT Value**: Rapid-fire triggers for DPS vs precision triggers for accuracy-focused builds

### 4. Mags (Magazines)
- **Function**: Affects **ammo capacity** and **reload speed**
- **NFT Value**: Extended mags for sustained fire vs quick-reload mags for burst playstyles

### 5. Stocks
- **Function**: Enhances **Stability** and **recoil control**
- **NFT Value**: Heavy stocks for precision vs light stocks for mobility

### 6. Scopes
- **Function**: Improves **Aim Assist**, **Range**, and **precision**
- **NFT Value**: Thermal scopes, 4x scopes, holographic sights for different engagement ranges

## Weapon Stats

Weapon performance determined by component combination:

- **DPS**: Damage per second (bullets + barrels + triggers)
- **Range**: Effective distance before damage falloff (barrels + scopes)
- **Intensity**: Raw damage output at optimal range (bullets + barrels)
- **Shots per Minute**: Fire rate (triggers)
- **Stability**: Recoil control and accuracy (stocks)

## Rarity Tiers & NFT Value

Components spawn at six rarity levels, with higher tiers commanding premium prices on secondary markets:

### Common
- **Cost**: Low (Holocrons)
- **Market Value**: Minimal

### Uncommon
- **Cost**: Low (Holocrons)
- **Market Value**: Low

### Rare
- **Cost**: Moderate (Holocrons)
- **Market Value**: Moderate

### Epic
- **Cost**: High (Holocrons or EV2 Tokens)
- **Market Value**: High

### Legendary
- **Cost**: Very high (EV2 Tokens)
- **Market Value**: Very High

### Exotic
- **Cost**: Premium (EV2 Tokens, tournament rewards)
- **Market Value**: Extreme

---

## Component Acquisition

### Looting (Primary Method)
- **Enemy Drops**: Kill enemies to loot random components
- **Boss Rewards**: Rare/Epic/Legendary components from bosses
- **Raid Drops**: Exotic components from 6-player raids

### Purchasing with Currency
- **Holocrons** (Free-to-Earn): Purchase Common, Uncommon, Rare components
- **EV2 Tokens** (Purchased/Won): Purchase Epic, Legendary, Exotic components

### Secondary Market Trading
- Trade individual components on blockchain marketplaces
- Component prices fluctuate based on meta (PvP/PvE effectiveness)
- Suit-specific demand affects prices (e.g., Auto-Cannon components valuable to Brute players)

## Weapon Skill Leveling (Non-NFT Progression)

- **Mastery Bonuses**: Unlocks handling improvements, reload speed, aim assist
- **Persistent**: Mastery progress stays with your account, not the NFT

---

## NFT Specifications

### Blockchain Integration
- **Asset Type**: EIP-721 NFTs (individual components)
- **Network**: Avalanche C-Chain (AVAX)
- **Tradeable**: All components tradeable on secondary markets
- **Verifiable**: On-chain stats and rarity
- **Future**: EIP-998 composable NFTs for complete weapon assemblies

### Web3 Rewards
- **Play-to-Earn**: Apex Trials (3v3 PvP) with EV2 token buy-ins
- **Tournament Rewards**: High-stakes competitions with Exotic component prizes
- **Battle Pass**: Season passes unlock Legendary/Exotic components

---

## Strategy & NFT Market Dynamics

### Meta-Driven Pricing
- Component prices fluctuate based on PvP/PvE meta
- Popular damage types (e.g., Armor Buster in tank-heavy meta) command premium prices
- Suit-specific components create niche markets

### Build Optimization
- Min-maxers pay premium for perfect component combinations
- "God rolls" (perfect stat combos) can be worth 10x+ normal components
- Flexibility: Swap components to adapt to meta shifts without buying new weapons

### Investment Strategy
- Early adopters can profit by identifying meta shifts
- Exotic components from tournaments retain long-term value
- Complete builds (6 components) sold as bundles command higher prices
