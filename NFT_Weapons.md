# Weapon Component System

## Overview

EV2's weapon system empowers players to **craft personalized firearms** using **modular components** looted from enemies/players or purchased with Holocrons (soft currency) and EV2 Tokens (hard currency). Components are tradeable NFTs that allow deep customization tailored to complement your suit (Brute, Cloaker, Pathfinder, Mag, Valkyrie) and playstyle across PC, PS5, and Xbox.

Unlike traditional looter-shooters with fixed weapon drops, EV2 lets you **build your own guns** by combining six component types: **bullets, barrels, triggers, mags, stocks, and scopes**. Each component modifies weapon stats like DPS, Range, Intensity, Shots per Minute, and Stability.

## Weapon Types

EV2 features three foundational weapon types, each with distinct characteristics:

### Bullet Weapons
- **Characteristics**: High Shots per Minute, moderate DPS
- **Examples**: Hand Cannons, Auto Rifles, SMGs, Sniper Rifles, Pistols
- **Best For**: Precision builds (Cloaker), sustained fire (Brute)
- **Playstyle**: Traditional gunplay with modular attachments

### Beam Weapons
- **Characteristics**: Continuous damage, high Stability
- **Examples**: Trace Rifles, Laser Weapons, Plasma Beams
- **Best For**: Sustained DPS (Mag), energy-focused builds
- **Playstyle**: Hold-to-fire mechanics with minimal recoil

### Rocket Weapons
- **Characteristics**: High DPS, low Shots per Minute
- **Examples**: Rocket Launchers, Grenade Launchers, Heavy Machine Guns
- **Best For**: AOE damage (Brute), explosive builds
- **Playstyle**: Burst damage with reload downtime

## Modular Component System

### The Six Component Types

Each weapon is crafted by combining **six components**, each modifying different stats:

#### 1. Bullets
- **Function**: Sets base **damage type** (Acid, Armor Buster, Fire, Ice, Impact, Lightning, Shield Breaker)
- **Impact**: Determines elemental/status effects
- **Examples**:
  - Fire Bullets: Burning DOT
  - Ice Bullets: Freezing/slowing
  - Armor Buster Bullets: Penetrates armor
  - Lightning Bullets: Chain damage
- **NFT Rarity**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic

#### 2. Barrels
- **Function**: Adjusts **Range** and **Intensity** (effective damage output)
- **Impact**: Long barrels increase range; short barrels boost close-range damage
- **Examples**:
  - Long Barrel: +Range, sniper builds
  - Short Barrel: +Intensity, close-quarters builds
  - Stabilized Barrel: Balanced Range and Intensity
- **NFT Rarity**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic

#### 3. Triggers
- **Function**: Modifies **Shots per Minute** (fire rate)
- **Impact**: Rapid-fire triggers for SMGs; slow, powerful triggers for Hand Cannons
- **Examples**:
  - Rapid-Fire Trigger: High Shots per Minute
  - Precision Trigger: Low Shots per Minute, higher accuracy
  - Burst Trigger: Fire in controlled bursts
- **NFT Rarity**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic

#### 4. Mags (Magazines)
- **Function**: Affects **ammo capacity** and **reload speed**
- **Impact**: Large mags = more ammo, slower reload; small mags = fast reload
- **Examples**:
  - Extended Mag: +Ammo capacity, slower reload
  - Quick-Reload Mag: Fast reload, standard capacity
  - Drum Mag: Massive capacity, very slow reload
- **NFT Rarity**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic

#### 5. Stocks
- **Function**: Enhances **Stability** and **recoil control**
- **Impact**: Heavy stocks reduce recoil; light stocks improve handling
- **Examples**:
  - Heavy Stock: Maximum Stability, slower aim
  - Light Stock: Fast aim, moderate Stability
  - Adjustable Stock: Balanced Stability and handling
- **NFT Rarity**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic

#### 6. Scopes
- **Function**: Improves **Aim Assist**, **Range**, and **precision**
- **Impact**: High-magnification scopes for sniping; red dots for close-range
- **Examples**:
  - Red Dot Sight: 1x magnification, precision reticle
  - 4x Scope: Long-distance precision
  - Holographic Sight: Projected reticle for mid-range
  - Thermal Scope: Heat signature detection
- **NFT Rarity**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Exotic

## Weapon Stats Explained

### Core Stats Modified by Components

- **DPS (Damage Per Second)**: Total damage output; affected by bullets, barrels, triggers
- **Range**: Effective distance before damage falloff; affected by barrels, scopes
- **Intensity**: Damage multiplier at optimal range; affected by barrels, bullets
- **Shots per Minute**: Fire rate; affected by triggers
- **Stability**: Recoil control and accuracy; affected by stocks, barrels

### Stat Synergies

Components create synergies when combined strategically:

- **Sniper Build**: Long Barrel + Precision Trigger + 4x Scope + Armor Buster Bullets = High-range, high-damage precision weapon
- **SMG Rush Build**: Short Barrel + Rapid-Fire Trigger + Extended Mag + Fire Bullets = Close-range, high fire-rate DOT weapon
- **Rocket AOE Build**: Heavy Barrel + Burst Trigger + Explosive Mag + Lightning Bullets = High DPS, chain-damage explosive

---

## Component Acquisition

### Looting

Components drop from enemies (PvE) or players (PvP):

- **Enemy Drops**: Kill enemies to loot random components
- **Player Drops**: In PvP, looting defeated players yields gear and components
- **Boss Rewards**: Rare/Epic/Legendary components from challenging encounters
- **Event Rewards**: Limited-time events distribute Exotic components
- **Loot Chests**: Hidden chests contain components

### Purchasing with Currency

Components available via in-game stores:

- **Holocrons (Soft Currency)**: Earned free through gameplay (PvE drops, missions, kills, daily challenges)
  - Purchase Common, Uncommon, Rare components
  - Repetitive earning allows free progression
- **EV2 Tokens (Hard Currency)**: Purchased or won in tournaments
  - Purchase Epic, Legendary, Exotic components
  - Faster progression or skip grinding

### Crafting Weapons

Combine six components to craft a complete weapon:

1. Select weapon type (Bullet, Beam, or Rocket)
2. Choose one component from each category (bullets, barrel, trigger, mag, stock, scope)
3. Preview stats (DPS, Range, Intensity, Shots per Minute, Stability)
4. Craft weapon (mints as NFT)
5. Equip on compatible suit (check weapon restrictions per suit)

### Secondary Market Trading

Components are tradeable NFTs on secondary markets:

- Trade individual components (e.g., Exotic Fire Bullets)
- Trade complete weapons (all 6 components as bundle)
- See [Second-Hand Economy](Second-Hand Economy.md) for pricing dynamics
