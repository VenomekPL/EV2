# Weapons NFT

## Overview

Weapons NFTs are non-purchasable, tradeable equipment earned through gameplay. Each weapon features randomized base attributes and rarity, creating diverse playstyles and build possibilities. The weapon progression system is the most extensive in EV2, allowing players to unlock transformative upgrades and modifiers that fundamentally reshape how weapons function. Weapons serve as the primary means of combat customization and specialization.

## Weapon Acquisition

### Gameplay Drops

Weapons are earned through active combat:

- **Enemy Drops**: Defeated enemies randomly drop weapon blueprints
- **Boss Rewards**: Challenging encounters grant rare weapon drops
- **Loot Chests**: Hidden throughout world containing weapon designs
- **Event Rewards**: Limited-time events distribute exclusive weapons
- **Challenge Completion**: Difficult tasks unlock special blueprints

### Weapon Blueprints

Most weapon loot comes as blueprints rather than finished NFTs:

- **Blueprint Drops**: Common loot from all encounters
- **Crafting Recipe**: Blueprint contains full weapon specifications
- **Conversion to NFT**: Use [In-Game Currency & Rewards](In-Game Currency & Rewards.md) to mint blueprint into blockchain NFT
- **Multiple Copies**: Same blueprint can be found multiple times
- **Blueprint Trading**: Can trade blueprints before minting (optional)

### Crafting System

Players craft weapons from collected resources:

- **Blueprint Requirement**: Must have blueprint to craft
- **Material Investment**: Gather components from missions
- **Crafting Time**: Different weapons require different production times
- **Relic Fragment Cost**: Use [In-Game Currency & Rewards](In-Game Currency & Rewards.md) to mint final NFT
- **Customization Options**: Choose cosmetic variants during crafting

## Weapon Randomization

### Base Attributes

Every weapon spawns with randomized core statistics:

- **Damage**: Amount of harm per shot (varies by weapon type)

### Rarity System

Weapons spawn at different rarity tiers:

- **Common**: Standard base stats, limited upgrade paths

### Stat Distribution

- Higher rarity weapons have superior base stats
- Stat distributions randomized fairly within rarity tier
