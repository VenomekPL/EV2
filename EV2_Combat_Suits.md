# EV2 Combat Suits

## Overview

**EV2 Combat Suits are character classes**, not tradeable NFT items. Similar to Destiny 2's Hunter/Titan/Warlock system, players select one of five suits—Brute, Cloaker, Pathfinder, Mag, or Valkyrie—each with unique abilities and weapon restrictions.

**Critical for NFT Economy**: Suits themselves are NOT NFTs or purchasable items. Players progress their chosen suit through XP, gear upgrades ([NFT Gear](NFT_Gear.md)), and weapon crafting ([NFT Weapons](NFT_Weapons.md)). The suit is your character class—permanent and account-bound.

## Why Suits Affect NFT Value

### Weapon Restrictions
Each suit has **specific weapon compatibility**, directly impacting weapon component NFT value:
- Auto-Cannons valuable to Brute, worthless to Mag/Pathfinder/Cloaker
- Hunting Rifles valuable to Cloaker, unavailable to others
- Beam weapons valuable to Mag and Valkyrie

### Gear Optimization
Different suits prioritize different gear stats ([NFT Gear](NFT_Gear.md)):
- **Brute**: Values Torso (damage absorption) and Helmet (weapon damage)
- **Cloaker**: Values Legs (movement speed) and Jetpack (stealth)
- **Pathfinder**: Values Arms (ability damage) for drone synergy
- **Mag**: Values Arms (cooldown reduction) for ability spam
- **Valkyrie**: Values Jetpack (flight speed) and Torso (survivability)

This creates **distinct NFT markets** where gear pieces command different prices based on suit-specific demand.
