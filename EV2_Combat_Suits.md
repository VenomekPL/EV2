# EV2 Combat Suits

## Overview

**EV2 Combat Suits are character classes**, not tradeable NFT items. Similar to Destiny 2's Hunter/Titan/Warlock system, players select one of five suits—Brute, Cloaker, Pathfinder, Mag, or Valkyrie—each with unique skills, jetpack mechanics, and weapon restrictions. Each suit channels a distinct El'Dar energy core to counter Zadrovan's parasitic corruption.

**Important**: Suits themselves are NOT NFTs or purchasable items. Players progress their chosen suit through XP, gear upgrades ([NFT Gear](NFT_Gear.md)), and weapon crafting ([NFT Weapons](NFT_Weapons.md)). The suit is your character class—permanent and account-bound.

## The Five EV2 Suits

### 1. Brute (Tank)

**Role**: Durable frontline protector, absorbing damage and shielding allies  
**Energy Core**: Graviton Engine (purple) - crushes Vreck with gravity wells  
**Playstyle**: Heavy armor, close-to-mid range, high survivability

#### Skills
- **Ordnance**: Mortar Strike - shoulder-mounted mortar targets multiple enemies; primes/detonates combos
- **Utility**: Shield Boost - boosts ally shields or weakens enemies (allies usable)
- **Melee**: Slam - ground/air smash in cylindrical radius; air deals higher damage
- **Ultimate**: Siege Cannon - three-charge AOE explosion, devastating combos
- **Combo**: Combo Blast - amplifies combo damage in radius

#### Weapon Restrictions
All handheld guns except Heavy/Machine Pistols; includes Auto-Cannons and Grenade Launchers

#### Stats
Higher Armor/Shield multipliers; uniform battery cap for jetpack; auto-heal at 5% HP/sec after 7 seconds without damage

#### Backstory
In Vault-7, Commander Everett Rowe sealed the blast door against the first Vreck incursion. Parasites hammered for seventeen minutes while the Smith welded reinforcements. When the door gave, Rowe's graviton punch caved a titan's chest. The Brute was born—first into every breach, last to leave, every dent a Vreck skull.

### 2. Cloaker (Assassin)

**Role**: Stealthy killer excelling in swift, lethal strikes and evasion  
**Energy Core**: Spectral Engine (red) - phases through burrow paths  
**Playstyle**: High agility, hit-and-run tactics, precision strikes

All handheld guns except Auto-Cannons/Grenade Launchers; includes Heavy/Machine Pistols, Hunting Rifles, SMGs

#### Stats
High agility; uniform battery cap for jetpack; auto-heal at 5% HP/sec after 7 seconds without damage

#### Backstory
Three days after the Brute's baptism, a Vreck scout slipped past the front line. The Smith grafted a spectral core from a downed Vreck phantom. The first Cloaker phased through concrete, reappearing behind the scout with a blade in its spine. No sound. No trace.

### 3. Pathfinder (Pet/Support)

**Role**: Versatile support with drone pet for healing, shielding, and damage

#### Backstory
When Vreck tunnels undermined resistance bunkers, the Smith salvaged a pre-war drone's nuclear core. Pathfinder's drone swarm mapped every burrow in seconds. A yellow flare marked the nest; a micro-nuke followed. Pathfinder became the rebellion's eyes.

### 4. Mag (Caster DPS/Heal)

#### Stats
High energy; uniform battery cap for jetpack; auto-heal at 5% HP/sec after 7 seconds without damage

#### Backstory
The hive mind jammed radios, turning squads into screaming static. The Smith cracked open a chaos core—blue energy crackling like broken lightning. The first Mag walked into a Vreck chorus, raised a hand, and shattered the signal. Parasites dropped mid-leap.

### 5. Valkyrie (Support/Tank-Healer)

- **Ultimate**: Dimensional Rift - opens portal allowing allies to teleport across map; enemies near portals take AOE damage (Fire/Ice); Valkyrie invulnerable during cast
- **Combo**: Rift Cascade - spreads rift AOE boosting ally damage (10%) or applying status effect (Shield Breaker) to nearby enemies

All handheld guns except Auto-Cannons; includes Heavy Pistols, Machine Pistols, Grenade Launchers

#### Backstory
When Zadrovan opened her first portal above the megacity, the sky bled green. The Smith fused a rift core and built a winged frame. The first Valkyrie leapt through the breach, rift blade carving the portal shut from inside. She fell back to Earth in a rain of parasite ash.

## Shared Suit Mechanics

### Battery System
All suits share a **uniform battery cap** that powers:
- **Skills**: Ordnance, utility, melee, ultimate abilities
- **Jetpack Flight**: Hovering, dashes, aerial maneuvers
- **Recharge**: Running recharges battery; looting enemies/players yields battery drops

### Combat Flow
- **Mouse-targeted shooting** with equipped weapons
- **Skills and jetpack maneuvers** to defeat foes
- **Auto-heal**: After 7 seconds without damage, suits heal at 5% HP/sec
- **Looting**: Killing enemies (PvE) or players (PvP) drops guns, ammo, gear, and battery

### Damage Types
All suits can deal damage through these types (via weapons and skills):
- **Acid**: Damage over time
- **Armor Buster**: Penetrates armor
- **Fire**: Burning DOT
- **Ice**: Freezing/slowing
- **Impact**: Knockback/stagger
- **Lightning**: Chain damage
- **Shield Breaker**: Anti-shield bonus

### Progression
- **XP**: Earned from kills, missions, objectives; unlocks abilities, gear slots, jetpack upgrades (no level cap)
- **Gear**: Loot 5 gear pieces (helmet, torso, arms, legs, jetpack) with stat bonuses - see [NFT Gear](NFT_Gear.md)
- **Weapons**: Craft custom weapons from components - see [NFT Weapons](NFT_Weapons.md)
- **Cosmetics**: Apply chroma skins - see [NFT Chroma Skins](NFT_Chroma_Skins.md)

## Suit Selection & Playstyle Matching

### Team Composition
- **Brute**: Holds frontline, protects squads
- **Cloaker**: Flanks, assassinates priority targets
- **Pathfinder**: Provides sustained support with drones
- **Mag**: Controls crowds, heals allies
- **Valkyrie**: Enables tactical repositioning, hybrid tank/support

### PvE vs PvP
- **PvE**: All suits viable; team composition matters for raids/dungeons
- **PvP**: Suit choice impacts playstyle; gear and weapons determine effectiveness
- **Web3 Integration**: High-performance kills in PvP/PvE earn EV2 tokens for battle pass or play-to-earn competitions
